### Common problem face by college students.

InCert.The idea of this word comes from the database command INSERT. InCert stands for CERTificates required for an INternship.<br>
Have you applied for an internship yet? If not, here is what you need to do- Firstly you need to visit the Training and Placement Office (TPO) of college to know the procedure. Then, you have to visit the Head of your Department(HOD) to get a letter signed and submit the same to the TPO requesting for the required certificates. This is followed by several visits to the placement office to collect the certificates until they are ready. This is time consuming process and take 4-5 working days.

### Here is where InCert come in handy.

InCert automated this entire process so that you can have your certificates without undergoing such a tedious process. In this era of technology where constant efforts are being made to minimize human efforts in all aspects of life, InCert serves the same purpose.<br>
In simple words InCert is basically the automation of the above mentioned process. It's a software wherein a student of college irrespective of where he is, can apply for the certificates just by logging in and selecting the certificates required, along with some necessary details and later get notified about the day he needs to go and collect the certificates from the placement office.<br>
Once the student has applied he can sit back and relax! What the software will now do is that it would send an email to the HOD for the necessary verifications where he can either reject or accept the student's application. If rejected, a mail would be sent to the student notifying him about the rejection of his application and asking him to meet the HOD the next working day. If accepted, an approval mail is sent to the applying student and another mail is sent to the placement cell about the student's application.<br>
The request will now be reflected in the database of our software InCert installed in the computers of the placement cell. The person in charge will be able to process single or even multiple applications in a go. Just by clicking the generate button, the certificates will be generated with the details of the students automatically populated in them and at the same time,sending an email to the students to collect the certificates from the office at the mentioned date and time.<br>
Taking the process online provides us several advantages like: It saves the crucial time of the student, the HOD would not have to leave his important work just to sign an application and the TPO can generate multiple certificates instead of typing one at a time.<br>
> In this age where people want everything on-the-go such an application not only makes everything convenient and immediate but also assures quality of work!
